## About

Screenshot Tray Tool is a small project I started to learn Electron, Node.js and improve my knowledge of javascript but, hopefully, the end result will also be a basic but useful tool. Once launched it adds an icon to the system tray and you can take screenshots using the "Ctrl + Shift + 3" shortcut (a notification will pop-up if everything went well, and clicking it will open the saved screenshot). More options are available right clicking the icon.

The current version saves the screenshots in the user's Desktop folder.
